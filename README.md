# Crystal Collector

A jQuery game created during UCF's web development bootcamp.

## How To Play

* Every round a randomly generated number is set as your target score.
* You must reach the goal exactly, by clicking on the 4 crystals.
* Each crystal has a hidden value and will add to your score.
* If your score goes passes the target score, you lose.
* The game will reset itself upon a win or loss.
